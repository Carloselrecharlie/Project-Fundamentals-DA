## Fundamentals of DA project
This is the project for the module *Fundamentals of Data Analysis* where I talk about box plots, touching on their history and explaining their bare bones and some related concepts along with their pros and cons.

In this repository there is a Jupiter notebook (.ipynb) which represents the core of my project. I recommend to download the full repository to your local machine, open your command line, lead it to the repo folder and then execute the command `Jupyter notebook` so that you can run it through your browser. The main libraries used are:

- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- pandas

so make sure you have the latest versions of them on your machine. Also see below the technical specifications.

Note that the  python magic command `%matplotlib inline` was already added to the notebook to assure the correct display of the plots.

### Technical specifications
The code within this project follows the Python version 3.6.4. In order to guarantee a normal code execution, the easiest way is to have Anaconda installed on your machine, you can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
