## Fundamentals of DA project
This is the assignment for the module *Fundamentals of Data Analysis* where I will try to explain the point of this package from Numpy with examples and plots. 

In order to run this Jupiter notebook I recommend to download the full repository to your local machine, open your command line, lead it to the repo folder and then run the command *Jupyter notebook* so that the browser executes it.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

If the plots are not displayed properly I suggest you to add this command `%matplotlib inline` before the code of the plot.

### Technical specifications
The code within this project follows the Python version 3.6.4. In order to guarantee a normal code execution you should have Anaconda installed on your machine, you can download it [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
